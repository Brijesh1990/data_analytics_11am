# What is Data? - Definition and Types

## Definition of Data

**Data** is a collection of facts, figures, measurements, and observations that are collected, recorded, and stored in various formats. Data represents raw, unorganized information that lacks context or interpretation. When data is processed, analyzed, and presented in a meaningful way, it becomes **information** and eventually **knowledge**.

### Key Characteristics of Data:
- **Raw**: Not yet processed or analyzed
- **Unorganized**: May lack structure or context
- **Factual**: Based on actual measurements or recordings
- **Measurable**: Can be quantified or qualified
- **Collectable**: Can be gathered from various sources

## Types of Data

### 1. **By Structure**

#### A. Structured Data
- **Definition**: Data organized in a predefined format, typically in rows and columns
- **Format**: Tables, databases, spreadsheets
- **Examples**:
  - Excel spreadsheets
  - SQL databases
  - CSV files
  - JSON objects
  - Relational databases

#### B. Unstructured Data
- **Definition**: Data without a predefined format or structure
- **Format**: Free-form text, images, videos, audio
- **Examples**:
  - Text documents (Word, PDF)
  - Social media posts
  - Emails
  - Images and photographs
  - Audio files (MP3, WAV)
  - Video files (MP4, AVI)
  - Logs and sensor data

#### C. Semi-Structured Data
- **Definition**: Data with some organizational structure but not in a rigid format
- **Format**: Partially organized with metadata
- **Examples**:
  - XML files
  - JSON documents
  - Emails (with headers and body)
  - Web pages (HTML)
  - NoSQL databases

### 2. **By Data Type (Variable Type)**

#### A. Quantitative Data (Numerical)
- **Definition**: Data represented by numbers; can be measured and compared
- **Subtypes**:
  - **Discrete**: Whole numbers, counts (e.g., number of students, items sold)
  - **Continuous**: Any value within a range, decimals allowed (e.g., height, temperature, weight)

#### B. Qualitative Data (Categorical)
- **Definition**: Data describing qualities or characteristics; non-numerical
- **Subtypes**:
  - **Nominal**: Categories without order (e.g., colors, gender, country, profession)
  - **Ordinal**: Categories with a natural order (e.g., rating scale 1-5, education level, satisfaction level)

### 3. **By Collection Method**

#### A. Primary Data
- **Definition**: Data collected directly from the source for a specific purpose
- **Collection Methods**:
  - Surveys and questionnaires
  - Interviews
  - Observations
  - Experiments
  - Focus groups

#### B. Secondary Data
- **Definition**: Data already collected and published by others
- **Sources**:
  - Books and journals
  - Government reports
  - Websites
  - Previous research studies
  - Databases and data repositories

### 4. **By Source/Origin**

#### A. Internal Data
- Data generated within an organization
- Examples: Sales records, employee data, financial statements

#### B. External Data
- Data obtained from outside sources
- Examples: Market data, weather data, social media data, government statistics

---

### 5. **By Time Dimension**

#### A. Cross-sectional Data
- Data collected at a single point in time from multiple subjects
- Example: Survey results from different people in January 2026

#### B. Time Series Data
- Data collected from the same subject over multiple time periods
- Example: Stock prices tracked daily for a year, temperature readings monthly

#### C. Panel Data
- Combination of cross-sectional and time series data
- Example: Sales data for multiple products over several years

---

### 6. **By Scale of Measurement (NOIR)**

#### A. Nominal Scale
- Categories without order or ranking
- Examples: Blood type, color, brand names
- Operations: Counting, frequency

#### B. Ordinal Scale
- Categories with a natural order/ranking
- Examples: Customer satisfaction (poor, fair, good, excellent)
- Operations: Sorting, ranking, median

#### C. Interval Scale
- Numerical data with equal intervals but no true zero
- Examples: Temperature (°C), IQ scores
- Operations: Addition, subtraction, mean, standard deviation

#### D. Ratio Scale
- Numerical data with equal intervals and a true zero point
- Examples: Height, weight, age, income, distance
- Operations: All mathematical operations including multiplication and division

---

### 7. **By Volume**

#### A. Big Data
- Extremely large volumes of data (Terabytes, Petabytes)
- Characterized by: Volume, Velocity, Variety
- Examples: Social media data, sensor networks, satellite imagery

#### B. Small Data
- Limited volume of data
- Example: Survey from 100 people, small CSV file

---

### 8. **By Format/File Type**

- **Text Files**: .txt, .csv, .json, .xml, .md
- **Spreadsheets**: .xlsx, .xls, .ods
- **Images**: .jpg, .png, .gif, .tiff
- **Audio**: .mp3, .wav, .flac
- **Video**: .mp4, .avi, .mov
- **Documents**: .pdf, .docx
- **Databases**: .db, .sql
- **Archives**: .zip, .rar

## Data vs. Information vs. Knowledge

| Aspect | Data | Information | Knowledge |
|--------|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Definition** | Raw facts and figures | Processed and organized data | Understanding and insights |
| **Form** | Unorganized, raw | Structured, meaningful | Wisdom, expertise |
| **Example** | 25, 30, 28, 35 (numbers) | Average age = 29.5 years | Understanding age demographics helps in business strategy |

## Why Data Matters

1. **Decision Making**: Data-driven decisions are more effective
2. **Patterns and Trends**: Helps identify patterns and predict future trends
3. **Business Value**: Drives innovation and competitive advantage
4. **Problem Solving**: Provides evidence for problem diagnosis and solutions
5. **Performance Measurement**: Tracks and evaluates progress and success
