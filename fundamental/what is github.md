what is github ?
## Git

**Git** is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files and code over time. It allows you to:
- Save snapshots of your project (commits)
- Create branches to work on features independently
- Merge changes from different branches
- Revert to previous versions if needed
- Collaborate with other developers on the same codebase

Git works locally on your computer and stores the complete history of your project.

## GitHub

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories online. It provides:
- A centralized location to store and share your code
- Collaboration tools (pull requests, code reviews, issues)
- Project management features (project boards, milestones)
- Integration with other development tools
- Public and private repository options
- Social features (following developers, starring projects)

## Key Differences

| Feature | Git | GitHub |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Type | Version control system | Cloud hosting platform |
| Location | Runs locally on your computer | Cloud-based service |
| Purpose | Track file changes and history | Host and collaborate on repositories |
| Usage | Command-line tool | Web interface + Git integration |

## Simple Workflow

1. **Git**: You use Git locally to create commits and branches
2. **GitHub**: You push your commits to GitHub to share with others
3. **Collaboration**: Others can pull your changes or submit pull requests to contribute
