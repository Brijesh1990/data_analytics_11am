what is github ?
## Git

**Git** is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files and code over time. It allows you to:
- Save snapshots of your project (commits)
- Create branches to work on features independently
- Merge changes from different branches
- Revert to previous versions if needed
- Collaborate with other developers on the same codebase

Git works locally on your computer and stores the complete history of your project.

## GitHub

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories online. It provides:
- A centralized location to store and share your code
- Collaboration tools (pull requests, code reviews, issues)
- Project management features (project boards, milestones)
- Integration with other development tools
- Public and private repository options
- Social features (following developers, starring projects)
