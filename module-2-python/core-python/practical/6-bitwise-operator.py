# bitwise operator 
# this is used to act on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations
# this is used to find size of binary numbers

# examples of bitwise 

# 1. bitwise NOT 
# 2. bitwise shift
# 3. bitwise AND
# 4. bitwise XOR
# 5. bitwise OR 
 
# it will be compared two numbers if number size is 1 bit it return  otherwise return 0
# a=1
# b=2
# print(a & b)

# a=10
# b=4
# operator takes two equivalent length bit designs as boundaries if two bits in the looked at position are 0, the next bit is zero if not it is 1.
# print(a | b)


a=10
b=-10

# a=10   0000 1010
print("a >> 1=", a >> 1 )
print("b >> 1=", b >> 1 )
