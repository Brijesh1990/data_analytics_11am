# variables in python 
  A variable is used to stored information of data 
  A variable have an data types 
  A variables is many types of data types ...
  **examples**
  a=10
  b=20
  c="brijesh"
  name='brijesh kumar pandey'
  d=10.56

  ```
  a=10
 b=20
 c="brijesh"
 name='brijesh kumar pandey'
 d=10.56

 # print(name)
 print(type(name))
 print(type(a))
 print(type(c))
 print(type(d))
 ```

 ## rules of variables in python 
  1. variable name must start with a letter or underscore
  2. variable name can not start with number
  3. variable name can not contain special character except underscore

## how to find keyword in python 
  1. import keyword
  2. print(keyword.kwlist)  

## indentation in python 
  1. indentation is used to define a block of code in python 
  2. indentation is used to define a function in python 
  3. indentation is used to define a loop in python 
  4. indentation is used to define a condition in python

## casting in python 
  1. type casting is used to convert one data type into another data type 
  2. type casting is used to convert string into integer or float 
  3. type casting is used to convert integer into string or float 
  4. type casting is used to convert float into string or integer

  **examples**
  ```
  a=10
  b=20.56
  print(type(a))
  print(type(b))
  a=str(a)
  b=int(b)
  print(type(a))
  print(type(b))
  ```

## variables case sensitivity in python 
  1. variable name is case sensitive in python 
  2. variable name can be same but with different case 
  3. variable name can not be same with same case

  **examples**
  ```
  a=10
  A=20
  print(a)
  print(A)
  ```  

## data type of variables in python

   which types of values stored in python that is called data type of variables in python

   1. integer data type is used to stored whole number in python 
   2. float data type is used to stored decimal number in python
   3. string data type is used to stored sequence of characters in python
   4. boolean data type is used to stored true or false value in python
   5. list data type is used to stored multiple values in python
   6. tuple data type is used to stored multiple values in python but it is immutable
   7. set data type is used to stored multiple values in python but it is unordered and unindexed
   8. dictionary data type is used to stored multiple values in python but it is unordered and indexed
   9. complex data type is used to stored complex number in python
   10. none data type is used to stored null value in python
